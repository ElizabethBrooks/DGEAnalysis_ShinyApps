## Installation

> [!TIP]
> The edgeR app can be run on a computer locally using Posit. To run the app locally we need to download the edgeR R Shiny app script. The script is in a GitHub repository and can be downloaded [HERE](https://github.com/ElizabethBrooks/DGEAnalysis_ShinyApps/tree/main).

<b>First,</b> download the GitHub repository using the git clone command in the terminal, for example:

```
git clone https://github.com/ElizabethBrooks/DGEAnalysis_ShinyApps.git
```

<b>Next,</b> if running the app locally, we will need to install or update [R and Posit](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (formerly RStudio).

<b>Lastly,</b> we need to install all of the necessary R packages with the software needed to run edgeR and create plots with the results:

```
EXAMPLE
```

The above code can also be found at the top of the R script for the edgeR app, which is located in the <i>apps</i> directory of the GitHub repository that we downloaded.

## Data Format

Before running the EXAMPLE app, make sure to have ready the two .csv files with the <b>EXAMPLE</b> and <b>EXAMPLE</b>. Example data for the EXAMPLE app can be found in the <i>data/EXAMPLE</i> directory of the GitHub repository.



## Analysis Workflow

To run the EXAMPLE app, open the R <b>script app_EXAMPLE.R</b> in Posit and press the <i>Run App</i> button in the upper right corner of the [source pane](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/ui/ui-panes.html).

### Part One: Getting Started



### Part Two: Data Normalization



### Part Three: Data Exploration



### Part Four: Analysis & Results



## Example Script

> [!NOTE]
> An example R script named <b>script_EXAMPLE.R</b> with code for performing the same analysis as in the edgeR R Shiny app can be found in the <i>scripts</i> directory of the GitHub repository. 

The script is hard coded to work for an example data set and will need to be customized for use with other data sets.
